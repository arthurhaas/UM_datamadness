We might build the following story:

We are social media strategy advisors focusing on video creation on youtube.
Title: How to make your perfect youtube video?

**Questions:**

- For which category do you have the highest likelihood of succeeding depending on the country you are in?
- How did the consumption of youtube videos by country change over time?
- What are the factors for a video becoming popular? Let's be more specific:
	- Should we prefer longer or shorter titles for as many views as possible?
	- How to use the title, tags and description for as many likes as possible?
	- *As a nice-to-have, we will look at whether clickbait still works? Text mining. Trying this out, we hope it will work ;)*
